The activity in this data frame are WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.
Other varaibles are sensors signal (accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz).Two varables of linear acceleration and angular velocity are derived in time and frequencey for "Jerk" signals.

The varaibles that were estimated from these signals are mean(), and std().
The first column is  "Subject" for different people in the group/
The second column is "activity" for different activites.
Descrptive names for the rest, the following names stands for:
Acc:Accelerometer
Body:Body accelration
t:time
f:frequency
Cyro:gyroscope
Jerk: Jerk signal
Mag:Magnitude
x:x-axis
y:y-axis
z:z-axis
mean():mean vale
std():standard deviation value
